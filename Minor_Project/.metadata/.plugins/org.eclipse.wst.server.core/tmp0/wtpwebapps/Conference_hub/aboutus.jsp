Communication is very much essential and the importance of it is increasing from time to time along with the evolution of 
human needs. The purpose of conference alert  system is to provide a platform for the users to view the information about 
the conferences that took place in the past and the ones which are about to take place in the near future. The users  can 
first login into the system and see through the information such as details about the conferences like topic of the 
conference, its time, venue etc. The  admin  can login and update the information ,delete any unwanted data ,arrange the 
information accordingly so that the user can go through an user friendly and know all the whereabouts of the upcoming 
conferences.<br/>

</br>Normally in Telephone Conference, there will be more than two users connected at a time and all the users have to
 be present at the same time but this may not be possible  sometimes since they did not know about the  conferences. 
So by implementing this system ,email alerts will be send to the people to let them know about the conference earlier so
 that they are able to attend and be prepared for it.<br/>
This system is to develop in a client/server environment.
The system will select the particular number of people and send e-mail alerts to them which let them know about the upcoming conferences and all the details about it. In that case to participate in any important conference or to conduct any conference will be become very easy.
